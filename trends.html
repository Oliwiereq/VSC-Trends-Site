    <h1>Trends of VSC</h1>

    <h2>CI/CD Integration</h1>

    <p>VCS is now the starting point for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). When code is committed, it automatically triggers a "pipeline" that builds, tests, and deploys the application, automating the release process.</p>

    <h2>Cloud Collaboration Hubs</h2>

    <p>Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are no longer just for hosting code. They are all-in-one hubs that integrate:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Project management (issue trackers)</li>
        <li>Code review (pull requests)</li>
        <li>Built-in CI/CD automation</li>
    </ul>

The modern standard is the Distributed (DVCS) model, used by Git and Mercurial. In a DVCS, every developer "clones" the entire repository, including its full history, onto their local machine. This allows for offline work, provides massive redundancy (every clone is a backup), and enables powerful, flexible workflows. This model excels at branching (creating isolated lines of development) and merging (combining changes), which are central to modern, parallel development.</p>
